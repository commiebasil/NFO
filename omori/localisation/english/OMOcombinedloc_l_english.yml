#EVENTS
 OMO_event.1.t:0 "Arrest"
 OMO_event.1.desc:0 "A man in a dark raincoat walked forward down the street. It was pitch dark outside, despite the fact that the time was only five minutes to nine. He walked the streets of San Francisco. Suddenly, he turned around and entered the apartment building. Having found the right apartment, he, with clearly measured movements, rang the doorbell and introduced himself: «The Housing and communal services!». There were heavy footsteps outside the door. The door swung open. Behind her stood Pluto. Suddenly, 4 men dressed in black uniform jumped out from behind the suspicious person. They took Pluto outside, put him in an inconspicuous car and drove off in an unknown direction."
 OMO_event.1.a:0 "Nobody saw him again."
 OMO_event.2.t:0 "Camp"
 OMO_event.2.desc:0 "The inspector from Faraway drove through the deserted streets of Los Angeles. The rainy weather gradually changed. He moved to the outskirts of the city, where there were many buildings, enclosed by a concrete wall with barbed wire. From the outside, this structure looked like a prison, but this place served one day not for the execution of justice. The lion's share of the population of Los Angeles was exiled here for "Unacceptable racial affiliation." The inspector had to check the conditions at the labor camp located in the northeast of the city. When he saw this place from the side, some unpleasant thought slipped through him, but he did not attach any importance to this and passed through the security post. Mutilated, thin former residents of Los Angeles worked here for 16 hours a day for a tiny ration, regularly tortured by the guards of this institution. The inspector didn't care, he was just doing his job, like everyone else here. He inspected the technical equipment, quickly assessed the condition of the boiler house, he tried to leave this place as quickly as possible."

He got here for a long time, besides, they did not want to accept him in Himmler's personal office for a long time, but now he has achieved his goal. They talked for a long time, the topics were different: from the position of California as the weakest place for the United States to racial cleansing. When the conversation was over, Himmler was very pleased: If he brought the Third Reich a new ally in the heart of the United States, this would significantly raise him up the political ladder. Then Kel decided to stop by in Hamburg where he tasted the burgers of the same name."
